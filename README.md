# automated-data-cleaning-tool
This project is a Flask-based web application that allows users to upload CSV files and automatically cleans the data by replacing missing or empty values in numeric columns with their respective mean values. The cleaned data is then saved as a new CSV file, and the filename along with the cleaning timestamp is stored in a database.
